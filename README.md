# About Me

I am **Hossein Amiri**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at **Emory University**.  
My research focuses on **software engineering**, **high-performance computing**, **spatial data science**, and **simulation-based modeling**.  

I develop reproducible and scalable software systems that integrate advanced engineering principles with data-driven scientific discovery. My work aims to enable efficient, transparent, and high-fidelity computational frameworks for large-scale simulation and analysis.
