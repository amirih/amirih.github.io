### Abstract
This paper introduces the EPIPOL disease simulation model, constructed upon the Patterns-of-life simulation, designed to produce human trajectory data. Over recent years, a surge in disease simulation models has been observed, each distinctive in its design and functionality. The primary objective of these models is to predict infection patterns for specified diseases in hypothetical settings, based on all available disease characteristics. A challenge that EPIPOL addresses is the typical rigidity of these models, which are often tailored for a specific disease. Thus they demand profound software expertise for modification. In our demonstration, participants will experience the user-friendliness and clarity of EPIPOL by: (1) selecting disease presets to initialize variables; (2) dynamically adjusting these variables during the simulation for enhanced precision; and (3) visualizing disease propagation in any globally mapped location.
