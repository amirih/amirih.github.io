### Abstract
Individual human location trajectory and check-in data have been
the driving force for human mobility research in recent years. How-
ever, existing human mobility datasets are very limited in size
and representativeness. For example, one of the largest and most
commonly used datasets of individual human location trajectories,
GeoLife, captures fewer than two hundred individuals. To help
fill this gap, this Data and Resources paper leverages an existing
data generator based on fine-grained simulation of individual hu-
man patterns of life to produce large-scale trajectory, check-in, and
social network data. In this simulation, individual human agents
commute between their home and work locations, visit restaurants
to eat, and visit recreational sites to meet friends. We provide large
datasets of months of simulated trajectories for two example regions
in the United States: San Francisco and New Orleans. In addition
to making the datasets available, we also provide instructions on
how the simulation can be used to re-generate data, thus allow-
ing researchers to generate the data locally without downloading
prohibitively large files.
